			<h2>The Svoboda Family: Anton Svoboda</h2>
			<p>
				Anton Svoboda (1796-1878) was a Viennese crystal merchant born in Osijek (Croatia) who traveled early in the 19 th century to Istanbul and thence to Baghdad with a warrant from the Ottoman Sultan to set up a business. He started a successful company, became a pillar of the European community, married the daughter of an Armenian business man and raised a family of 11 children.

			<!--<p>The story of the Svoboda diaries is many faceted. In the early 19th century, a businessman named Anton Svoboda (1796-1878) traveled from Vienna to Baghdad via Istanbul where he received an imperial warrant allowing him to establish a business in imported crystal and other commodities in Baghdad. There he married an Armenian woman, Euphemie Muradjian, and founded a large family of 11 children who later married into French Catholic, British, Russian and Arab Christian families and became prominent in the Baghdad expatriate community. By the first quarter of the 19th century, Anton had become an important figure in the city, with ties to Davud Pasha, the Mamluk ruler of the province, and to the powerful British resident. When Western scholars and travelers came to Baghdad, they were often hosted by Anton and assisted by his local contacts. For example, when the great Tibetan linguist, Alexandre Csoma de Koros left his native Transylvania for the Himalayas in 1820 and ended up by chance in Baghdad, he was housed, fed, and subsidized financially by Anton Svoboda for 45 days. During this time, Svoboda also put him in contact with the British Resident, Claudius-James Rich, to whom Csoma applied for a subsidy to enable him to complete his journey. A year earlier, Anton Svoboda had invited the inveterate traveler, adventurer, and self-proclaimed "physician", the Fleming Johan-Martin Honigberger and his companion, a Transylvanian surgeon named de Tiurck, to enter the service of Davud Pasha. During their stay they too lived with Anton who also helped them resume their journeys.</p> -->

			<h2>The Svoboda Diaries Project: History and Future</h2>
			<p>The Svoboda Diaries Project, originated in helping Iraqi researcher and architect Nowf Allawi who was transcribing and translating Alexander Svoboda’s travel journal with her supervisor, Prof. Henry Svoboda, the last of the Svobodas in Baghdad.  That help grew into a full-scale project employing as many as 30 under-graduate interns a year.  It continues as an effort to publish the 45 Joseph Mathia Diaries.
